# Why MayaJS?

**MayaJS** makes it easy to build complex RESTful api, maintainable routing, easy API versioning, shareable services, and reusable logic.

# Easy to use

We developed this framework with adaptability as the priority.

- Beginner-friendly and accessible for any skill level.
- Assists in making complex routes through built-in CLI.

# Simple yet Powerful

When building production quality RESTful applications, managing your routes becomes the priority. We as developers want to simplify our workflow.

What does Mayajs do that makes this simple development possible:

- Gives declarative ways of defining routes.
- Simplifies adding route files through our CLI.
- Enables sharing business logic using services.
- Creates routes using method declaration.
- Near-independent from typescript declarations unlike most frameworks.

# Typescript

Mayajs is built with Typescript. With its vast support from the community, we believe that Typescript will be the best language for us moving into the future. Typescript's type checking feature also increases development efficiency.

What are the benefits with using Typescript for MayaJS:

- Declarations for defining methods, controllers and services.
- Dependency injection and meta-programming.
- Safer codes for development and production.
- Uses latest and upcoming javascript features.
- Type checking while coding not on runtime.
- Less runtime errors.

# In Between

As seen here, Mayajs is the combination of both Express and Nestjs. Like Express we utilize middlewares, which means all middlewares created using express can be used inside Mayajs. For Nestjs we also utilize declarations, dependency injections, and reflections. With this you can have the benefits of both frameworks in one package.
