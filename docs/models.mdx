# Models

This will define the model that a controller can use to communicate to a database. This model is also mapped the data/fields to be save or modified to a database. Our framework support both MongoDB and Sql database. See database section for more informations on how to implement these databases.

To generate a model you can run this command on your terminal.

```js
maya generate model "model-path"
```

Short hand command.

```js
maya g m "model-path"
```

This command will create a model file based on the model-path provided.

Below shows a codeblock generated inside the model file.

**Model for MongoDB Databases**

```js
import { MongoSchema, MongoModel } from "@mayajs/mongo";

const schema = MongoSchema({
  // Add mongo fields here
});

export default MongoModel("Sample", schema);
```

**Model for Sql Databases**

```js
import { SqlModel } from "@mayajs/sql";

const schema = {
  // Add sql fields here
};

export default SqlModel("Sample", schema, {});
```
