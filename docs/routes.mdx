# Routes

Adding and creating controllers, models and services separately can be tiring task if you do it repeatedly. We created this command to help users generate these 3 files and put them on one folder.

To generate a route you can run this command on your terminal.

```js
maya generate route "route-name"
```

Short hand command.

```js
maya g r "route-name"
```

This will creates a **controller, model** and **service**. This will also create a folder from the given route-name and put all the created files inside. Each created files will have the same naming convention based on the route-name.
