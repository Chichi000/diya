# Service

Services can make your code shareable accross your application. A service can be injected inside of a controller or another service inside a class constructor. You can seperate your business logic inside your routes using a service and share it across different services.

To generate a service you can run this command on your terminal.

```js
maya generate services "service-path"
```

Short hand command.

```js
maya g s "service-path"
```

This command will create a service file based on the service-path provided.

Below shows a codeblock generated inside the service file.

```js
import { Injectable } from "@mayajs/core";

@Injectable() // This decorator allows this class to be injected on other modules
export class SampleServices {
  constructor( // Inject other services here) {}
}
```
