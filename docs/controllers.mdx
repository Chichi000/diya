# Controllers

A controller acts a route that has its own sub-routes which handles all the incoming request from the client. You can define a sub-routes using method decorators that describe what kind of request it will accepts. You can also add middlewares and validations inside of these method decorators. See method section for more information on how to implement middlewares and validation.

To generate a controller you can run this command on your terminal.

```js
maya generate controllers "controller-path"
```

Short hand command.

```js
maya g c "controller-path"
```

This command will create a controller file based on the controller-path provided.

Below shows a codeblock generated inside the controller file.

```js
import { Get, Patch, Post, Delete, Put } from "@mayajs/common";
import { Controller } from "@mayajs/core";

@Controller({
  model: "./sample.model", // Name of the model for this route
  route: "/sample", // Name of the route
})
export class SampleController {
 constructor( // Inject services here ) {}
}
```
